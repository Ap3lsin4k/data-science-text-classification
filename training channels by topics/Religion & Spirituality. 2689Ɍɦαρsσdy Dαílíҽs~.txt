 BLESSINGS IN HIS PRESENCE
  
Pastor Chris

 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them (Luke 5:17).        

Sometime ago, I was in a programme with several ministers from different countries. During the Question and Answer segment, many of them asked questions bothering on various subjects, and I shared with them answers from the Scriptures. 

But while at it, I noticed by the Spirit that all the time they were asking the questions and we were looking through the Scriptures for the answers, the Spirit of God was ministering to us in a very special way. Several of them that came with heart conditions, chest problems and some other ailments suddenly realized they had been healed. The ailments they came into the meeting with were no longer there! 

There were healing miracles everywhere even though we didn’t particularly pray for the sick. That‘s what happens in His presence; your questions are answered; problems are solved; burdens are lifted; His glory in your life is enriched and activated. Hallelujah! 

When you’re under the influence and ministry of the Word and the Spirit of God, you notice something happening in your life, even though you may not be able to tell it in words immediately. That’s how so many people can be blessed at the same time in the presence of God. 

In His presence, there’s guidance; there’s direction; there’s life! No wonder the psalmist exclaimed: “Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore” (Psalm 16:11). In His presence, you’re guided by His truth, into all truth; there’s revelation; every form of confusion gives way. 

This year, make fellowship with God a priority. Study the Word voraciously and pray in tongues fervently EVERY DAY. He’s given us a life of fulfilment; a life of singing and praising and thanksgiving. Maintain and live in that glory every day and experience the supernatural; the joy, peace and prosperity that’s beyond this world. Glory to God!

CONFESSION
In fellowship, I receive God’s Word that puts me over in life, and my faith is built strong, causing me to ride upon the high places of the earth, walking in abundance, wisdom of the Spirit, and keeping me perpetually above all evil and terror, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

 PEACE IS FROM GOD
  
Pastor Chris

 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world (John 16:33).         

Paul the Apostle declared: “But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not…” (2 Corinthians 4:3-4). The god of this world is Satan, and he’s the one responsible for the mess and chaos in the world. 

The way the world is right now, the structures and systems of the world that’s driven by selfishness, wickedness, greed and hatred is designed by Satan. The implication of this is that the systems and structures of this world can never give peace. Peace is from God, just as righteousness is from God. 

It’s impossible for people who have never received the life and nature of God to deliver true peace. Not even your family and friends can give you lasting peace, happiness, and joy. In John 14:27, Jesus said, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” Blessed Be God! 

The peace the world is looking for is in Jesus Christ; no wonder it eludes them, because they’re searching for it in the wrong places. The Bible says, “...When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape” (1 Thessalonians 5:3). This is the dilemma that the world is in today.

In our theme verse, Jesus said, “...In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” He overcame the world and gave you the victory over the world. It makes no difference what’s going on in the world, be at peace.

The peace that you have in your spirit is the peace of Jesus Christ; it gives you power over crises. Even in adverse circumstances, when it seems there’s trouble everywhere, His peace garrisons your heart and mind, causing you to be at rest in prosperity. Hallelujah!

CONFESSION
No matter what happens, irrespective of the turmoil, I’m unperturbed; I have the peace of Jesus Christ in my heart. Therefore, I’m full of confidence, because the Champion of Peace is my Lord! I have peace without agitation, full of rest and prosperity. Blessed be God!

TUESDAY 26

 NO COVENANT OF HEALING FOR THE NEW CREATION
  
Pastor Chris

 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed (1 Peter 2:24).        

Many of the Scriptures on healing that have been quoted by many well-meaning Christians aren’t applicable to the New Testament. In the Old Testament, God made provisions for the children of Israel, but those provisions and messages don’t apply to the Church.

Recall that the Old Covenant was abrogated because it made nothing perfect. You might ask, “How about the covenant of healing? Didn’t God say in Exodus 23:25, “…I will take sickness away from the midst of thee?” He also said in Isaiah 53:5, “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”

Now, none of these two references is for the Christian. God didn’t make a covenant of healing with the new creation. The covenant of healing was for Israel. When Jesus said on the Cross, “It is finished” (John 19:30), that was the end of the old covenant.

It’s important to understand who the Christian really is. The Christian is one with the God-life, a life that doesn’t require healing, because it doesn’t get sick. Why are many sick then? Ignorance! God said, “My people are destroyed for their lack of knowledge” (Hosea 4:6). 

The Bible says, “But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal (death-doomed) bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you” (Romans 8:11). The Holy Spirit, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you and has vitalized your mortal body. That means your body isn’t deathdoomed or sickness prone anymore. Hallelujah!

God’s people must know, live, and spread the truth. When you become a Christian and you receive the Holy Spirit, you should NEVER be sick again in your life. What you need is the consciousness of the divine life in you, and the fact that the Holy Spirit perambulates in you to ward off every anomaly, and keep you in health.

CONFESSION
The same Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead has vitalized my body. Sickness has no place in me, because the life of God permeates me through and through. I live in divine health and impact my world with the God-life in me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

 THE FULLNESS OF THE SPIRIT
  
Pastor Chris

 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (John 7:38)        

Why would any Christian read this and still be asking for more power or double portion anointing? It’s a contradiction! You have the Spirit living in you in His fullness. The anointing is the effect of the power and presence of the Holy Spirit; why ask for the effect when you have the causative personality in you? 

The Holy Spirit is the power, strength, and wisdom of God. He’s the Spirit of grace and He lives in you as a person. He took up His abode in you with the totality of His being. The fullness of His glory and power should be freely expressed in and through you. 

The Holy Spirit in you makes you more than a man. There’s a divine energy working in you; it doesn’t burn out, neither does it require replenishing. Refuse therefore to be limited by your physical ability; your potentials are limitless! The Holy Spirit works in you mightily to achieve results that are beyond human ability and comprehension (Colossians 1:29). Affirm this in your life always.

Philippians 2:13 says, “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” The God that works in you is the Holy Spirit; He causes you to be willing, and then propels you to do the Father’s will. You can stir up His power to flow in and through you more by speaking in tongues, and meditating on the Word. Hallelujah!

CONFESSION
I’m full of power, grace and glory, because the Holy Spirit lives in me in His fullness! He’s my ability and the strength of my life. I’m perfected in Him, exuding His righteousness, peace, joy and excellence, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

 YOUR PROCLAMATION MAKES IT REAL
  
Pastor Chris

 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13).        

For your faith to produce results, not only must you know the Word and have it in your consciousness, you must speak it forth. The power is in affirmation. We believe, and therefore, we speak. If you don’t say it, it’ll not happen.

The Word of God is truth; it’s already established in heaven. Psalm 119:89 says, “For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.” But it becomes settled in your life by your affirmation. The way it works is this: you keep the Word in your consciousness through meditation, then your confession or proclamation establishes it.

In Mark 11:23, Jesus said, “… whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.” When the Word is in your heart, and spoken forth, it becomes a creative force.

Remember, God’s Word created everything; therefore, it can and will create anything. Whatever you desire today, the power to make it real is in your mouth. Jesus said a good man, out of the good treasures of his heart, brings forth good things (Luke 6:45). Through meditation, you create good things in your heart; then just as the Father did in the book of Genesis after incubating on the earth’s chaotic mass, you release words.

Words are things; they have creative energy. Use your faith-filled words to frame your world, and programme your spirit for success, victory and ever increasing glory.

CONFESSION
I have been blessed with, and in all things, and the Lord has made me fruitful and productive. With my proclamations of faith, I disallow sickness, disease, infirmity and weakness from my body, and banish trouble, depression, poverty and frustrations from my life and family. Health, strength and abundance are my birthrights. I walk in the glory of God, manifesting the righteousness of Christ. Hallelujah!

SATURDAY 23

 THE CHURCH IS THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST
  
Pastor Chris

 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence (Colossians 1:18).        

Did you know that Jesus isn’t complete without us? And by “us,” I mean the Church. We’re inseparably united with Him (1 Corinthians 6:17). Ephesians 1:22-23 says He “…put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.” He’s the one who fills everything (Ephesians 4:10), yet His fullness is the Church, which is His body. 

This should help you understand your importance and relevance to Christ. You’re “in Him,” and He’s “in you.” Through you, He expresses His love to the world, and establishes His Kingdom in the earth. You’re His extension in the earth, because you hail from Him and are connected to Him. He said in John 15:5, “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” It’s the Father’s grand design for Him to need us just as we need Him: He’s our glory as we are His glory. 

In John 17:19-21, Jesus prayed, “…that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.” This prayer of Jesus is fulfilled in us today; He’s made us one with divinity.

1 Corinthians 12:13 says, “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body….” Then, 1 Corinthians 6:17 declares, “…he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.” We’re literally mingled with the Spirit as one divine creation: “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit” (1 Corinthians 12:13). Blessed be God!

CONFESSION
I belong in the family of Christ—the Church! And in Christ, I’m in health, wealth, splendour, prosperity and glory. The glory of God is seen and manifested through me to my world. My life is a continuous manifestation of Christ and the supernatural! Blessed be God!

FRIDAY 22

 CELEBRATE WHEN THE SQUEEZE IS ON
  
Pastor Chris

 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal (2 Corinthians 4:17-18).         

Why should a Christian read the scriptures, like our theme verse above and still gripe and moan about challenges? It makes no difference the pressure you face from the adversary; refuse to give in. Never be flustered by circumstances or threats.

Christ lives in you and He’s the greater One. Therefore, when you face crises, declare, “Greater is He that’s in me than all the adversities and adversaries that could ever come against me!” Whatever you may be going through today is a light affliction; it came “to pass.” So refuse to allow anything steal your joy.

Even our transient troubles produce for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The Word says so; hence, it’s the only outcome to expect. That’s why you must rejoice in the face of adversity. James 1:2 (TPT) says, “…when it seems as though you are facing nothing but difficulties see it as an invaluable opportunity to experience the greatest joy that you can!”

Celebrate and rejoice in the Lord when the squeeze is on. Don’t focus on the problem. Fix your gaze on Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith. In Him you triumph ALWAYS, and in every situation. Glory to God!

CONFESSION
I rejoice in the Lord, His eternal Word and power to put me over all adversities. The Lord is the strength of my life, and I fear nothing and no one. In Him I triumph gloriously always and in every situation, reigning in righteousness, and growing in grace, wisdom and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

THURSDAY 21

 SEE BY THE WORD AND SPEAK ACCORDINGLY
  
Pastor Chris

 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal (2 Corinthians 4:18).         

We’re not supposed to be victims in the earth, but victors. But many Christians live as victims, as captives of adverse circumstances, because they neither see nor live by the Word. The adversities, pressures and difficulties of life aren’t a factor. Paul, in the preceding verse to our opening scripture, calls them “light affliction, which is but for a moment….” 

In other words, to you, that problem or adverse circumstance may have been for ten years, but it’s subject to change, and guaranteed to work for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. How? The answer is what we read in our opening verse! Stop looking at your present physical condition; see the invisible. 

When you see the invisible, the wilderness experience will end. See God doing great things in your life and through your life this year. See yourself prosperous, healthy, vibrant and strong. See yourself walking in victory and in the glory of God. See the picture, accept it, and speak accordingly. Consider the story of Abraham in Genesis 17. He took his gaze off what his physical senses dictated to him and looked at the invisible through the eyes of the spirit. He saw himself as the father of many, just as God had said.

The Apostle Paul, in Romans 4:17, explains to us that Abraham believed what God had said concerning him: “(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.”

This is the beginning of a new year; something you must do consciously and consistently every day is to boldly declare who you really are. Don’t speak failure; don’t speak defeat. Have the right vision. See from God’s perspective. Meditate on and declare His Word.

When you affirm what God has said about you, your soul will be adjusted to act that way. Whatever God has said about you, endorse it, believe it, and affirm it to yourself consistently (Hebrews 13:5-6). Consciously programme your life with the Word of God.

CONFESSION
I see myself making progress with giant strides; my path is that of the just that shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. My focus is on the Lord and His Word; His Wisdom guides and rules my life. I see and walk in victory, health, prosperity and joy, now and always, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
