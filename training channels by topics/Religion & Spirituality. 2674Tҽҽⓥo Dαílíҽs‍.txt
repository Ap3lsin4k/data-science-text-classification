(Jesus Christ, The Son Of God, Is God In Human Flesh)\n\n👤 Pastor Chris \n\n📖 TO THE BIBLE\nRomans 8:14 “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.”\n\n▶️ LET’S TALK\nA friendly conversation ensued between the Care Group leader and his members as they sat down to lunch together. \n\n“Who do you reckon is the best superhero in the world?” Erik, the Care Group leader, started. \n\n“That’s easy: it’s Ironman or Superman,” Adrian said. \n\n“No, it’s Wonder woman,” Leona replied. \n\nWhen Erik was asked his own response to the question, he simply said, “It’s the Lord Jesus, because all the ones you’ve mentioned are fictional, but Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, the God-man is real!” \n\nThe expression “sons of God” isn’t a description of parental or ancestral relationship. For example, when we say, “Jesus Christ is the Son of God,” what that means is that Jesus Christ is the “God-man.” That’s why when Jesus told the Jews He’s the Son of God, they wanted to stone Him to death. They understood what He meant; He said, “I’m the God-man,” which means “God in human flesh.” \n\nThe Jews knew what He meant because they said, “How can you, a man, make yourself equal with God?” for that, they were ready to kill him because, in their religious minds, that was blasphemy. They understood He wasn’t just talking about his birth parents, for they already knew Mary was his mother and assumed Joseph was his father. Jesus became the ‘firstborn’ of the Father when He was raised from the dead, and the Father said to Him, “…You are My Son, today I have begotten You” (Acts 13:32,33; Colossians 1:18; Hebrews 1:5, 6). \n\nThat’s why the Bible says that Jesus heads up the new creation. He’s called the “first” and not the “only” begotten from the dead because of the rest of us! When He died on the cross, He was our representative; we all died in Him. When God raised Him up, we were raised in Him. Thus, in Christ, you’re the god-man. Psalm 82:6 says, “I said, “You are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High.”” This was a prophetic language because we’re born of the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. Hallelujah!\n\n🎯 Go Deeper \n2 Peter 1:4; 1 John 4:17\n\n🔊 Pray\nDear Father, thank you for the consistent education and training of my spirit through your Word. By the power of the Holy Spirit at work in me, I take my place, and fulfil my ministry as the god-man in my world, and I declare that only the righteousness of God prevails in my environment, in Jesus’ Name.

I know there’re people who believe Christians ought to be poor, but that’s due to their lack of understanding of the Scriptures. Poverty is not the absence of money, or other required necessities of life; it’s actually the disabling of a man’s mental prowess. It’s that state where a person’s mind shuts down, and that person believes that he or she can’t do anything to change his state. But that’s not the case with the one who’s born again and lives by the Word; it’s impossible for such a person to walk in penury. The Christian is an heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ. \n\nAll the wealth in this world belongs to you if you’re born again. Once you accept this truth in your spirit, and allow it dominate your thinking, it’ll give you a new mindset. It’ll be impossible for you to walk in lack. The Bible says Jesus became poor so that we, through His poverty, might become rich (2 Corinthians 8:9). He took upon Himself, not only the sins of the world, but also the effects of sin, one of which is poverty. This is the reason every Christian must reject poverty.\n\nNevertheless, poverty by choice, or deprivation by persecution is acceptable. A Christian may walk poor, and live poor because of ignorance, but he’s not poor, for he actually has an inheritance in Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:21 says, “…all things are yours.” Therefore, refuse and reject the down life; don’t live as a victim.\n\n🎯 Go Deeper \n2 Peter 1:2-3; Psalm 23:1-2\n\n🔊 Pray\nDear Father, you’re gracious and kind. I thank you for making me a joint-heir with Christ; the world belongs to me. All things are mine, and nothing good is withheld from me. I dwell in the realm of superabundance, where I’m graciously supplied with every good thing. My life is a manifestation of your love and grace; thank you, Lord, in Jesus’ Name.

(Exercise Yourself In Godly Character)\n\n👤 Pastor Chris \n\n📖 TO THE BIBLE\n1 Timothy 4:7 NIV “Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly\n\n▶️ LET’S TALK\nThe word “godly” above actually means piety towards God, piety to spiritual or godly activities. It means devotion. It doesn’t refer to inner righteousness or inherent holiness. It’s about the things you do, how you respond to God, and to the things of God. For instance, there’s a way you ought to behave when you come into the house of God, because church isn’t like everywhere else. It’s a place of worship. There’s an attitude of reverence you ought to have when you come to church. \n\nGodliness is about your demeanour. Your dressing matters; some piety is necessary in your dressing. There’s a decency that goes with the Spirit of God, and that decency must be in your life. There’re outward things that people should see in you, and say, “Yes, this is a Christian.” They can’t see it in your heart, but can see it in your character. That’s what godliness is about. There’re movies you shouldn’t watch. There’re books or magazines you shouldn’t read. There’re places you just shouldn’t be found in, because you’re different. \n\nAnd if for any reason you find yourself in such places, you ought to go in there with godly piety. Yes, that’s the life you’ve been called to live. Your presence in a place should exude and transmit the righteousness of God, for you’re a tree of righteousness, producing fruits of righteousness. Never lose sight of who you are; you’re different. You’re the symbol and embodiment of God’s glory, perfection, beauty, and righteousness. \n\nSee and carry yourself as such: always remember that “...you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9 AMPC).\n\n🎯 Go Deeper \n2 Peter 3:10-11, Psalm 1:1-3\n\n🔊 Speak\nDear Father, I thank you for giving me your righteousness as a gift, and inspiring in me the consciousness to walk in a perfect state of piety. I live true to my nature and calling in Christ as I bear fruits of righteousness and inspire many by my piety to spiritual and godly activities, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.\n\n📚 Daily Bible Reading\n \n  ONE  YEAR\n╚═══════╝\nMatthew 18:15-35, Exodus 10-12\n\n  TWO YEAR\n╚═══════╝\nActs 12:20-25, Job 22-23\n\n▶️ Act\nRead and meditate on Matthew 5:48 and 2 Peter 1:5-7.\n\nToday’s Rhapsody in Pídgín English: https://t.me/rhapsodypidgin\n\n✍️ My Notes \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________', 'Rhapsody of Realities TeeVo\n\nMonday, January 25\n\nWORD-LIKE THOUGHTS  (Get Your Thoughts Directly From God’s Word)\n\n👤 Pastor Chris \n\n📖 TO THE BIBLE\nRomans 12:2 NASB “...Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.”\n\n▶️ LET’S TALK\nAs a Christian, it’s important how you think and what you think about. You’re not of this world; therefore, you shouldn’t think like an ordinary person. Don’t say, “I’m American, or I’m Australian, as a result, there’s a way I think.” No! When you’re born again, you cease to be of your earthly nativity, because your spirit is recreated. You should therefore only think the Word-way. God’s Word must form the basis for the kind of thoughts you process and allow. Now that you’re in Christ, you have a new culture: the Christ-culture. Until this becomes a reality in your spirit, you’ll live like an ordinary person and not experience the sublime blessings of life in Christ. \n\nThe Bible says, “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17). You’re of a new lineage and heritage. Refuse to be described by any earthly culture or affiliation. If you must be identified as a Zulu, Afrikaans, American, British, German, French, Nigerian, etc., let it be because you want to win those of such descent to Christ.\n\nThat’s how the Apostle Paul puts it. He said, “To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the Law, I became as one under the Law, though not being under the Law myself, so that I might gain those who are under the Law” (1 Corinthians 9:20 NASB). \n\nOur opening verse, in the New International Version says, “Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind….” As you meditate on the Word, your mind is programmed to think accordingly. You’ll begin to talk differently and act in line with your confessions of faith. The Word of God is the only material that can energise you for success, position you for greatness, and sustain you in the transcendent life.\n\n🎯 Go Deeper \nRomans 12:2 AMPC; Philippians 4:8\n\n🔊 Pray\nDear Father, thank you for the education of my spirit, through your Word. As I study and meditate on the Word, my mind is renewed in knowledge and spiritual understanding. Therefore, through my knowledge of the Word, I allow only excellent things into my world, in Jesus’ Name.

The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?” He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm…They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!””\n\n▶️ LET’S TALK\nThe Lord Jesus, when He walked the earth, was a marvel and master over circumstances. One day, the disciples, in awe of Him, asked the question we read in our opening verse. This was after He hushed a billowing tempest to sleep. On another occasion, the disciples had sailed far out at sea when they suddenly saw a figure walking towards them on the water; it was Jesus. Again, they wondered, “What manner of man is this that defies nature?”\n\n Think about His ascension to heaven! He simply levitated and went through the clouds into heaven. It pays to know who Jesus really is. Until you know Him, you can’t have true faith in Him, and you wouldn’t know yourself. Here’s something most extraordinary: anyone who believes in Jesus receives the same life that He has. John 1:12-13 says, “But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God… who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”\n\nNotice that the latter part says you’re born of God, meaning that you’re born of the same Word that became Jesus. 1 Peter 1:23 says, “Having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever.” James 1:18 NIV says, “He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.” We’re in the same class and manner of men as Jesus, because we’re offspring of the Word. \n\nNo wonder John said, “...In this world we are like Jesus” (1 John 4:17 NIV). All of divinity was tabernacled in Jesus; He was God alive—walking and talking in a man’s body. That same fullness of divinity dwells in you today. Like Him, you’re the living, moving house of the living God. Hallelujah!\n\n🎯 Go Deeper \nActs 17:28; 2 Corinthians 6:16\n\n🔊 Speak\nI’m the temple of the living God, His mobile headquarters in the earth today. In Him I live, and move, and have my being. The greater One lives in me; I’m filled with His fullness, and dispense the verities of the Kingdom in every place.

It’s that simple. That is the substance of our Message.”\n\n▶️ LET’S TALK\nAs a Christian, you’re essentially the image of Christ; you’re the Christ that your world sees. Every step you take should be the expression of the divine life in you. Your words and actions, the life you live, the way you do the things you do, should express the Christnature in you. You’ve been called to show off God’s glory. \n\nThat’s how Jesus lived when He walked the earth. He was the manifestation of God: the expression of the divine life. You’re Christ alive to your world, your family, neighbourhood, school, city, and country; therefore, when people look at you, they should see the glory of the new creation. \n\nThink about a fashion model who adorns exquisite dresses and shows them off to an audience, a magazine or other media platforms; You’re a God-carrying vessel and you ought to show off this Christ-life to your world so they could glorify your Father in heaven. \n\nTrue success is God manifesting and expressing Himself in, and through you; it’s how much His personality and character are revealed through you. Your goal, therefore, should be to reveal Him always.

(Make Jesus Christ The Lord Of Your Life)\n\n👤 Pastor Chris \n\n📖 TO THE BIBLE\nPhilippians 2:9-11 CEV “Then God gave Christ the highest place and honored his name above all others. So at the name of Jesus everyone will bow down, those in heaven, on earth, and under the earth And to the glory of God the Father everyone will openly agree, “Jesus Christ is Lord!”\n\n▶️ LET’S TALK\nA young man once boarded a train, and on his way, his cabin mates asked him to join them in a game, but he replied, “I’m sorry, I didn’t come with my hands.”\n\n“What do you mean?” they asked perplexed because they could see his hands on either side of his body.\n\n“These hands that you see aren’t mine; they belong to my Master, Jesus Christ, and I only use them to do what He commands me to do,” the man explained. He went further to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with them, and they were gloriously saved!\n\nWhen we say, “Jesus is Lord,” it’s much more than a religious expression; it means He’s One with supreme authority. He’s Master and Ruler; He’s the One to be reverenced and adored! That’s what “Lord” means. Some have only been acquainted with Him as Saviour, but He’s more than a Saviour. He’s the One that has the pre-eminence, and to whom service and obedience are due.\n\nYou must know Jesus in this light and walk in this consciousness every day. In your family, academics, finances and everything that has to do with your life, relate to Him as Lord! In other words, let Him have supremacy and ascendancy. Let Him have the final say in all that concerns you. Remember, He’s the only wise God; therefore, submit to the supremacy of His will, counsel and wisdom.\n\nAnd if you haven’t yet made Jesus the Lord of your life, say this prayer and mean it with all your heart: “O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ, Son of the living God. I believe He died for me and God raised Him from the dead. I confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of my life. Through Him and in His Name, I have eternal life; I’m born again.
