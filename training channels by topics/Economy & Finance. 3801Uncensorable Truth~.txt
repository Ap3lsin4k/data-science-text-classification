An estimated 156,000 African American children might have been spared debilitating neurological injury if the CDC scientists had told the truth when the increased risk was first known to them in 2001.

💥Recent studies show that African Americans have a stronger immune response which also increases risk of vaccine injuries: 
Dr. Gregory Poland at the Mayo Clinic states that “African Americans have much higher antibody responses to this viral vaccine, rubella, than we have seen in any other population.” He goes on to say that the dose given to African Americans is two times stronger than it needs to be and that this increases the risk of vaccine injury (video in the first link below).
.
In 2017, a study by a prestigious team of Scandinavian scientists found that the DTP vaccine, while protecting African children from Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis, was wreaking havoc with their immune systems. Vaccinated children were dying at up to 10 times the rate of unvaccinated children.
.
A 2010 study in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health showed that black boys were at significantly greater risk of regressing into autism after receiving the thimerosal-containing Hepatitis B vaccination series as infants.

💥The Tuskegee Experiment shows the CDC’s continued blatant disregard for public health in the African American community: 
In 1972, a government whistleblower, Peter Buxtun, told Senator Edward Kennedy, that for the previous forty years, beginning in 1932, the CDC and the U.S. Public Health Service conducted the so called “Tuskegee Experiment” to study the progression of untreated syphilis in impoverished African- American men in rural Alabama.
.
According to the CDC, which took over the study in the early 1960s, none of 299 syphilitic sharecroppers were ever told they had the disease. The CDC purposefully withheld penicillin from the men and lobbied against their recruitment by the U.S. army which would have given them mandatory syphilis treatment.
.
The agency actively prevented participants from accessing syphilis treatment programs elsewhere. CDC’s victims in that study included numerous men who died of syphilis, 40 wives who contracted the disease, and 19 children born with congenital syphilis.

💥The CDC recently experimented on low-income black and Hispanic infants without informing the parents:
Beginning in 1989, the CDC conducted an experiment on nearly 1,500 black and Hispanic infants in Los Angeles, using an unlicensed measles vaccine, without obtaining permission from the parents or disclosing that the drug was a high potency experimental vaccine.
.
The CDC only halted its secret experiment in 1991 when companion clinical trials conducted on illiterate populations in Senegal, Guinea- Bissau, and Haiti showed increased death rates and severe immune system disorders among female infants who received the vaccine.

💥In 1986, Congress gave liability protection to vaccine makers. The U.S. vaccine schedule has more than tripled since then:
Children who are injured by vaccines are forced into a separate court system (The Office of Special Masters within the United States Court of Federal Claims). Pharmaceutical companies do not even have to defend themselves — the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stands in on their behalf. There is no jury and no discovery. With liability protection, pharmaceutical companies seek to add as many vaccines as possible to the schedule in order to increase profits.
Children born in the 1940s, 1950s, or 1960s got 3 or 4 shots.
Children born in the 1970s or 1980s got as many as 12.
Today, the CDC recommends children get 53 shots with 74 different antigens by age 18.

💥None of the vaccines on the U.S. schedule were tested against an inert saline placebo in clinical trials:
Double blind randomized controlled trials are the “gold standard” in evidence based medicine. The Informed Consent Action Network (2018) reviewed the FDA applications for all of the vaccines currently on the national schedule and discovered that none of them used an inert saline placebo.
.
In 2013, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) studied the entire Childhood Immunization schedule and stated: “No studies have compared the differences in health outcomes… between entirely unimmunized populations of children and fully immunized children… Furthermore, studies designed to examine the long-term effects of the cumulative number of vaccines have not been conducted.”

💥54% of kids have at least one chronic illness (including ADHD, allergies, asthma, arthritis, autism, autoimmune disorders, cancer, diabetes, and obesity): 
A generation ago (before Congress gave vaccine makers liability protection) “only” 12% of children were chronically ill.
Today at least 54% of children have at least one chronic illness. Something has gone terribly wrong with the health of our children.
Yet neither government agencies nor mainstream medical institutions have responded effectively.

💥The CDC destroyed evidence that black boys are 3.36 times more likely to develop autism if they receive the MMR vaccine before age 3:
In August of 2014, CDC senior vaccine safety scientist, Dr. William Thompson, invoked federal whistleblower status and testified to Congressman William Posey that his vaccine branch supervisors had ordered him and other scientists to destroy data showing that black children were suffering disproportionate harm by the MMR vaccine.
.
Dr. Thompson issued a press release through his attorney stating, “I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism.”.
Per Theories of Causality: the Role of Infections published on the Johns Hopkins Medicine website (https://pathology.jhu.edu/autoimmune/causes): “Many of the theories about the causes of autoimmune diseases invoke a preceding infection (such as a viral infection) as the initiating factor.”

💥50 Million Americans Have an Autoimmune Disease - The American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association (AARDA) estimates that 50 million Americans have one or more autoimmune disease. (https://www.aarda.org/rare-autoimmune-diseases-individually-rare-collectively-common/#:~:text=The%20American%20Autoimmune%20Related%20Diseases,%2C%20pemphigus%2C%20and%20relapsing%20polychondritis.)
.
Scientists Believe That Environmental Factors Like Infections and Chemicals are Mainly Responsible for the Rise in Autoimmune Disease Rates - The following is from the Foreword to book the The Autoimmune Epidemic by Douglas Kerr, M.D., Ph.D.:
“Future research is unlikely to define a single cause for autoimmunity, but rather varied triggers that include environmental exposures and infectious agents interacting in complex ways with an individual’s immune system. This research will, in all likelihood, clearly establish the link between these exposures and autoimmunity and will begin to define how these exposures cause autoimmunity. 

“There is almost universal agreement among scientists and physicians that the environmental toxins and chemicals to which we are increasingly exposed are interfering with the immune system’s ability to distinguish self from non-self. Most of the risk of autoimmunity comes from environmental exposures rather than from genetic susceptibilities. So, have those environmental exposures changed over time? The answer is clearly yes. One example of this comes from a 2003 study in which blood and urine samples from Americans were tested for 210 substances, including industrial compounds, pollutants, PCBs, insecticides, dioxins, mercury, cadmium and benzene. The volunteers, none of whom had any occupational or residential risks for such exposure, had detectable levels of 91 of these. In other words, these are ordinary people with ordinary lives who have numerous toxins in their body from ordinary exposure. In a 2005 study, researchers found 287 industrial chemicals, including pesticides, phthalates, dioxins, flame-retardants, and the breakdown chemicals of Teflon, in the fetal cord blood of ten newborn infants from around the country—transmitted to the infants by their mothers’ exposures before and during pregnancy.
.
We are facing both an increasing prevalence of autoimmunity and an increasing exposure to environmental toxins. Is it clear that the increased exposure of environmental toxins is causing the increase in autoimmunity? Several lines of evidence suggest that this jury, too, has issued the verdict — “guilty.”

Johns Hopkins Website Says - From “Autoimmune Disease: Why Is My Immune System Attacking Itself?” (https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/autoimmune-disease-why-is-my-immune-system-attacking-itself) published on the the Johns Hopkins University website:
“When the body senses danger from a virus or infection, the immune system kicks into gear and attacks it. This is called an immune response. Sometimes, healthy cells and tissues are caught up in this response, resulting in autoimmune disease.”
.
💥💥Note: Vaccines are designed to create an immune response.💥💥Yes, vaccines cause autoimmune diseases.

This information is from CHD (link below): 
💥ARTHRITIS: 
In 1991, the government’s own Institute of Medicine released a report entitled “Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines”.
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234363/)
In that report, the committee stated that the evidence indicates a causal relation between the rubella vaccine and acute and chronic arthritis in adult women. They said:
“The evidence indicates a causal relation between the currently used rubella vaccine strain (RA 27/3) and acute arthritis. Incidence rates are estimated to average 13 to 15 percent among adult women following RA 27/3 immunization with much lower levels noted among children, adolescents, and adult men.”
.
There are many types of arthritis and some are considered an autoimmune disease. These include:
➡️Rheumatoid Arthritis
➡️Lupus
➡️Juvenile Arthritis
➡️Ankylosing Spondylitis
➡️Psoriatic Arthritis
➡️Scleroderma
➡️Sjogren’s Syndrome
➡️Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)
.
The authors did not discuss the types of arthritis in their study. The government researchers simply lumped everyone into “acute” and “chronic” arthritis.
.
💥GBS: 
in September 1993, the Institute of Medicine released another report entitled “Adverse Events Associated With Childhood Vaccines: Evidence Bearing on Causality.” (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236291/)
These scientists wrote:
.
“The evidence favors a causal relation between tetanus toxoid and GBS. If the evidence favors a causal relation between tetanus toxoid and GBS, then in the committee’s judgment the evidence favors a causal relation between vaccines containing tetanus toxoid (DT and Td) and GBS.”
.
GBS is Guillain-Barré syndrome. The government scientists are saying that vaccines that contain tetanus can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome.  These vaccines include DPT.
.
Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system attacks the body’s nerves. Weakness and tingling in the extremities are usually the first symptoms. These sensations quickly spread, eventually paralyzing the person. The rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome has almost doubled in 34 years.  Is this just a coincidence?
.
That same 1993 report found that “The evidence favors acceptance of a causal relation between OPV and GBS.”  OPV is oral polio vaccine.
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8182813/)
.
💥MISC:
A study from Italy looked at autoimmune diseases reported after vaccination. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5607155/)
.
The researchers said, “Molecular mimicry and bystander activation are reported as possible mechanisms by which vaccines can cause autoimmune reactions.”
