WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE FED'S MONETARY POLICY MEETING?

A sharp recovery in demand for company shares on Tuesday and the weakening of the dollar stopped. What can we expect today as the Fed announces its views on monetary policy and how it will affect the future?

After a sharp collapse in the markets on Monday, a rebound was expected on Tuesday, which was accompanied by an increase in demand for company shares and a weakening of the American currency. The media explained these dynamics on Monday by the fact that investors were clearly closing long positions in shares and buying the dollar in anticipation of corporate reports of companies, which this week will be significantly saturated. On Tuesday, the growth in demand for risky assets and the weakening of the dollar was interpreted as a result of a good start in the publication of financial statements.

In my opinion, everything is not so simple. On the one hand, investors have really turned their attention to companies' reporting and this affects the demand for shares, but, on the other hand, I believe that not only this factor affects the dynamics of the markets, but also a number of other reasons.

As I previously indicated, there is a high likelihood that the Fed will begin to reduce the volume of government bond buybacks later this year in the wake of the expected recovery of the American and global economies. The recently published economic statistics are likely to indicate the formation of a negative bottom in the economy, from which it will push off and begin to vigorously recover in the spring of this year. In this case, the American regulator can make it clear at the end of today's meeting that it will closely monitor this process, although in general, it will retain its rhetoric regarding a soft monetary exchange rate and a promising, low level of interest rates. But this will be a signal for the market, which can push up the growth of Treasury yields, and this will be an important supporting factor for the dollar rate.

On the other hand, these hints on the wave of expectations of a dynamic recovery of the American economy may prompt Congress, if not to talk about the new support measures from Joe Biden in the amount of $ 1.9 trillion, then significantly reduce the amount of aid. This will be a strong negative signal for investors who previously actively bet on this factor when buying shares in companies. Such prospects may serve as a reason for a local correction in stock markets and an increase in the dollar in the future.

What to expect soon:

Concerning today's possible dynamics in the markets, I do not expect any significant changes, unless, of course, the Fed and its leader Jerome Powell say something out of hand. Most likely, the local decline in shares, which began on Monday, will resume, which will be accompanied by the growth of the American currencyAverage weekly earnings including bonuses in the UK rose 3.6 per cent from the previous year to ¬£ 567 in the three months to November 2020, the largest increase since September of 2019 and well above market expectations for a 2.9 per cent increase in wages each year.  From the public sector (4.2%) and the private sector (3.3%);  And in services (4.3 per cent) and financial and business services (5.4 per cent);  Industrialization (0.8%);  Wholesale, retail, hotels and restaurants (3.1 percent).  In contrast, wages continued to decline in the construction sector (-1.1%).  Excluding bonuses, nominal wages also jumped 3.6 percent.  Current average wage growth rates are affected by a decrease in the number and proportion of lower-wage jobs compared to before the coronavirus pandemic;  It is estimated that core wage growth - if the impact of this change in job characteristics is removed - is likely to be less than 2 per cent.CAN THE US STOCK MARKET AVOID FALLING INTO THE ABYSS?

The situation in the world markets remains moderately optimistic. This positive attitude of investors is supported by the firm opinion that against the background of the difficult situation on the labor market in the United States and the American economy, Congress will have no choice but to make a decision to approve the interest-free measures proposed by J–æ–µ Biden to support the national economy and American citizens in $ 1.9 trillion.

This belief is strong, and it continues to push the US stock indices up, and weakening the dollar. But during the past week that doubters have begun to appear in the ranks of investors who are not sure that support measures will be taken exactly in the proposed volume of $ 1.9 trillion. They believe that Congress can "cut" this amount. Moreover, not only representatives of the Republican Party but also some from the Democratic Party will be against such unprecedented expenses. This can also happen due to the reason that Congressmen understand that such spending will not solve the problems of the country's economy, which was primarily under the blow of COVID-19, but will only increase the size of public debt and stimulate the inflation of financial bubbles in the markets.

This process cannot go on forever. It will ultimately lead to the collapse of these bubbles and a collapse in the domestic financial market in America and in world stock markets, compared with which the crisis of 1929 will seem like a child's prank.

The process of dumping the American economy into the abyss can halt. The only way to help avoid that will be the vaccination of the U.S. citizens, but this process is extremely slow right now. The euphoria that was present in the markets at the end of last year completely disappeared and turned out to be premature. That is why we are witnessing the establishment of a certain equilibrium in the markets, which, as I previously thought, contributes to the overall preservation of the period of consolidation. The only asset that receives support from the current situation is the high-tech NASDAQ 100 index. It mostly includes stocks of companies that won during the acute phase of the pandemic last year and received support in the wake of expectations of improving relations between the United States and China, which is quite reasonably associated with the coming to power of the Democrats, whose economic model is based on close economic cooperation between the countries.

What to expect soon:

Observing everything that happens, I believe that the overall picture on the markets before the Fed meeting, which will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday and before the start of the vote in Congress on incentives, will generally remain the sameOur Amazing Members Opinion üòçThe IFO business climate index for Germany fell to 90.1 in January 2021 from an upwardly revised 92.2 in the previous month, below market expectations of 91.8.

My expectations regarding the inaugural rally of Joe Biden turned out to be correct. It is over now and investors fully turned their attention to the expected debate in Congress on the $ 1.9 trillion program of assistance to the American economy and citizens of the country proposed by the new president.

Equity markets moved in line with my expectations for consolidation. In addition to the implementation of the assistance program, the forthcoming reports on companies for the fourth quarter of last year began to play an important role. As for the general perspective dynamics of stock indices, I believe that it will fully depend on the success or partial success of the adoption of new incentives in the United States.

On Thursday, the ECB seemed to disappoint some market participants. Investors assumed that the regulator, leaving all the parameters of monetary policy, would nevertheless make it clear about concern about the high rate of the single currency. But he, in the person of his leader Christine Lagarde, stated only about low inflation, which cannot be pushed up to the target level of 2.0% and positive changes in the regional economy. Of course, Lagarde also spoke about other important fiscal policy issues, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer demand. She touched on the euro's exchange rate but said that the bank is "watching it closely." That's all. As a result of the meeting, the single currency received support against the dollar, albeit not so significant. The main role has already been played by the weakness of the American currency, which allows it to consolidate and not to fall like a stone.

Today, market attention will be drawn to the publication of data on business activity in Europe and America. If in Britain and in the Eurozone their slight growth is expected, in the States they are expected to decrease. According to the forecast, the index of business activity in the manufacturing sector PMI in the US in January should fall to 56.6 points against the December value of 57.1 points. The PMI PMI value in the US PMI in the current month should fall to 53.6 points against the December figures of 54.8 points.

What to expect soon:

I believe that locally bad values ‚Äã‚Äãcan push the American indices and the European ones locally upward, as investors believe that the negative dynamics will spur the authorities to pursue support measures more actively. At the same time, good values ‚Äã‚Äãcan lead to their decline due to lower expectations that prompt support measures can be taken, especially by Congress in America, as soon as possibleINVESTORS ARE WAITING FOR REAL DECISIONS FROM CONGRESS ON INCENTIVES

Today, the markets' focus will be on a political event that plays a significant role for the financial markets. Of course, I'm talking about the 46th US President Joe Biden's inauguration. Investors focus on the risks of acts of disobedience by a part of the population that does not agree that he won the election legitimately.

Besides, the results of the meeting of the Central Bank of Canada on monetary policy will also draw attention, although no one expects any surprises. 

The key interest rate is expected to remain unchanged at 0.25%, but investors will be interested in the regulator's view of future policy in the context of the remaining noticeable impact on the life of Canada of the coronavirus infection pandemic and the new president of America, which, could strongly influence its northern neighbor.

It will also be interesting to see the updated data on consumer inflation in the UK and the Eurozone. In Britain, the indicator is expected to grow both on an annualized and monthly basis, respectively, by 0.5% from 0.3% and by 0.2% from -0.1%. Meanwhile, the euro area is expected to stagnate in annual terms at the level of + 0.2%, but in monthly growth of 0.3% versus a decline of 0.3% a month earlier.

The most important will be a reaction of the Bank of England and the ECB to these essential macro indicators. We will probably see the European regulator's response at the ECB meeting tomorrow.

Yesterday the markets closely followed Janet  Yellen's speech to Congress. She broadcasted many important things to local deputies, touching on the entire spectrum of fiscal policy. Still, the main thing investors hear from her statement was her expectations on monetary policy. She reported on the need to keep interest rates low for a significant period of time. In this regard, it is essential to note that the US government debt market's reaction was mixed. The yield on 10-year Treasuries practically remained at the same levels, but on the 2-year Note, which is sensitive to possible dynamics of changes in the level of interest rates, decreased. All this points to the lack of a clear opinion of the markets regarding the Fed's actual actions. The market believes that the rise in inflation in the United States may force the Fed, despite promises not to change anything in monetary policy, to reduce the volume of bond redemptions, which will become factors in their continued sales and increase in yields. In this case, the dollar will receive support, and the general view of the market on its prospects this year may radically change.

What to expect soon:

I believe that today the market will either grow up on the wave of the fact that Biden took office or, most likely, consolidate, both in anticipation of the ECB meeting and further prospects of the implementation of the new assistance measures.The ZEW Economic Sentiment Index for Germany rose 6.8 points from the previous month to 61.8 in January 2021, slightly beating market expectations of 60.0.  The economic outlook for the German economy improved amid rising export expectations and despite uncertainty over the additional path of the closure.  About 71 percent of the analysts surveyed expected an improvement in economic activity in the coming months, 9 percent expected it to worsen, and 20 percent expected no changes.  The assessment of Germany's economic situation did not change much at -66.4.THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS THIS WEEK  

This week, all the world markets' attention will be turned to one of the most important events - President Joe Biden's inauguration, which will occur on January 20. 

This event is significant as it affects political life inside and outside the United States and financial markets. Last week's announced measures to help the American people and stimulate the national economy have had the opposite effect.

Why did it happen? 

I believe that this financial market reaction was associated with two natural reasons. The first is, well, a very significant promised amount of aid in the region of $ 2 trillion. Many investors doubt that this desire of the new Presidential Administration and personally of J–æ–µ Biden will be approved by Congress, which has a significant number of opponents of such a volume of aid and an enormous burden on its budget, which is already in an unprecedented deficit. Congress may simply not approve of this initiative. It will be a severe blow to the US stock market, which, using the rule of "buy on rumors and sell the news," has once again rewritten historical highs. Any discussion on this topic in Congress will lead to a renewed fall in demand for risky assets (company shares) and a resumption of the growth of the dollar.

At the beginning of the new year, American stock indices' correction after a prolonged consolidation period is already happening. It was caused, on the one hand, by profit-taking after a noticeably strong rally at the end of last year, an indistinct picture around the previously promised support measures, and on the other hand, on the wave of a technical factor. As I mentioned above, stock indices rose strongly, marking new historical highs, after which a correction usually occurs. And now investors are faced with a dilemma, whether it will be short and not deep, or, on the contrary, will drag on and turn out to be noticeably strong.

What to expect soon:

Assessing the market situation, I believe that the correction may continue. Today is a bank holiday in the USA due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day and activity on the markets will be lower than usual. I believe that this week there may be two scenarios. The first is the continuation of the corrective decline in stock indices with a simultaneous rise in the dollar exchange rate. The second is the start of the consolidation process in anticipation of Congress's decision on support measures.
